## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Load Data
```{r}
data("ChickWeight")

chickWeight = ChickWeight

head(chickWeight, 8)
```

# Subset of data that meet the condition Chick is equal four.
```{r}
sub1 = subset(chickWeight, chickWeight$Chick == 4)
head(sub1, 8)
```

```{r}
plot(sub1$weight ~ sub1$Time, data = sub1, col=palette(), pch=15, ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

```
```{r}
plot(sub1$weight ~ sub1$Time, data = sub1, type = 'l', col="blue", ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")
```

```{r}
boxplot(weight ~ Time, data = sub1,  col = "bisque", ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

points(sub1$weight ~ sub1$Time, data = sub1, type = 'b', col="red", ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

```
# Subset of data that meet the condition Diet is equal four.
```{r}
head(chickWeight, 8)

sub2 = subset(chickWeight, chickWeight$Diet == 4)
head(sub2, 8)

```

```{r}
boxplot(weight ~ Time, data = sub2,  col = "bisque", ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

```
# Compute the mean
```{r}
subAg = aggregate(weight ~ Time, sub2, mean)

head(subAg, 8)
```
# Subset of data that meet the condition Diet is equal two.
```{r}
sub3 = subset(chickWeight, chickWeight$Diet == 2)

head(sub3, 8)
```

```{r}
subAg1 = aggregate(weight ~ Time, sub3, mean)

head(subAg1, 8)
```


```{r}
plot(subAg$weight ~ subAg$Time, data = subAg, type = 'b', col="red",pch=15, ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

points(subAg1$weight ~ subAg1$Time, data = subAg1, type = 'b', col="purple",pch=19, ylab = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Time (hr)")

```
