## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Check the dataset package directory

```{r}
ls('package:datasets')
```
# Use one of the in-built datasets
```{r}
data("USArrests")

df = USArrests
df = na.omit(df)

head(df, 5)
```
# Standardize the dataset

```{r}
df1 = scale(USArrests)
head(df1, 5)

```

```{r}
set.seed(123) #Setting a seed ensures that the random numbers generated by R are reproducible
ss = sample(1:50, 15)
df1 = USArrests[ss,]
df1.scaled = scale(df1)
df1.scaled
```
# Euclidean Distance Matrix section
```{r}
library("factoextra")
dist.eucl = dist(df1.scaled, method = "euclidean")

dist.eucl
```

```{r}
round(as.matrix(dist.eucl)[1:3,1:3],1)
```

```{r}
library(cluster)

data(flower)
head(flower, 5)
```

# Distribution of Distances
```{r}

fviz_dist(dist.eucl)

```
