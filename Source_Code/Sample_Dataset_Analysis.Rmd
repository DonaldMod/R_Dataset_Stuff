## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Create a Sample Dataset
```{r}
Sample_Set <- replicate(200, runif(n = 10))

head(Sample_Set, 3)
```

# Sample Mean
```{r}
sample_means <- colMeans(Sample_Set)

head(sample_means, 20)

```

# Histogram with the means
```{r}
hist(sample_means, freq = T, main = "Means", col = palette(), xlab = "Average")
curve(dnorm(x), add = T, col="blue")
```
