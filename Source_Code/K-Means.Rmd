## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Initiate your dataset
```{r}
data("USArrests")

usa = USArrests

head(usa, 5)
```

```{r}
names(usa)

```
# Reproducible randomizer
```{r}
set.seed(123)
randomSample = sample(1:50, 15)
randomSample
```

```{r}
df2 = usa[randomSample,]

df2
```

```{r}
df2.scaled = scale(df2)

df2.scaled
```
# Euclidean Distance
```{r}
library("factoextra")

dist.eucl1 = dist(df2.scaled, method = "euclidean")

dist.eucl1
```

```{r}
round(dist.eucl1, 1)
```

```{r}
round(as.matrix(dist.eucl1)[1:3,1:3], 1)

```
# K-Means Clusters
```{r}
k_clusters1 = kmeans(USArrests, 3)
k_clusters1
```
```{r}
plot(df2$Murder, df2$Assault, col=k_clusters1$cluster, pch=19, cex=1, main = "Assault vs. Murder")
```
